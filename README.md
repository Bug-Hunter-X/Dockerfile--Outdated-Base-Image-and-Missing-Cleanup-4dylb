This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: using an outdated base image and neglecting to clean up after installations. The original `Dockerfile` uses `ubuntu:latest`, which is not recommended for production due to its instability.  The improved `DockerfileFixed` demonstrates best practices by specifying a specific Ubuntu version, cleaning up temporary files, and using a multi-stage build for a smaller final image.
